# Sepsis-Prediction

**Abstract**— Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, 
sepsis is a potentially fatal condition that can cause organ 
failure and death. In order to improve patient outcomes, 
sepsis must be detected early. The ability to predict sepsis 
before it develops to severe stages has recently shown
significant promise thanks to machine learning (ML) 
methods. In this study, we compare and assess the 
effectiveness of different machine learning (ML) models
for the forewarning of sepsis using a publically accessible 
dataset. Patients admitted to critical care units (ICUs) 
are included in the dataset's clinical information and 
diagnosed with sepsis. In order to train different ML 
models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, 
random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and 
artificial neural networks (ANNs), we will first 
preprocess the data, extract pertinent features, then train 
a variety of ML models. We will assess these models' 
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the 
curve (AUC) performance. Our results will provide 
insights into the most effective ML algorithm for a quick 
diagnosis of sepsis. This research can help clinicians 
make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes 
by predicting sepsis before it progresses to severe stages.
