# Sepsis-Prediction

**Abstract**— Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, 
sepsis is a potentially fatal condition that can cause organ 
failure and death. In order to improve patient outcomes, 
sepsis must be detected early. The ability to predict sepsis 
before it develops to severe stages has recently shown
significant promise thanks to machine learning (ML) 
methods. In this study, we compare and assess the 
effectiveness of different machine learning (ML) models
for the forewarning of sepsis using a publically accessible 
dataset. Patients admitted to critical care units (ICUs) 
are included in the dataset's clinical information and 
diagnosed with sepsis. In order to train different ML 
models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, 
random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and 
artificial neural networks (ANNs), we will first 
preprocess the data, extract pertinent features, then train 
a variety of ML models. We will assess these models' 
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the 
curve (AUC) performance. Our results will provide 
insights into the most effective ML algorithm for a quick 
diagnosis of sepsis. This research can help clinicians 
make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes 
by predicting sepsis before it progresses to severe stages.

# Sepsis Prediction Project 

## Introduction
This project aims to predict sepsis using Machine Learning (ML) models before it becomes severe by using a publicly accessible dataset that includes clinical information of patients admitted to critical care units (ICUs). The study compares various machine learning models to determine the most effective algorithm for a quick diagnosis of sepsis.

## Steps

### 1. Download the Dataset
The first step is to download the dataset used for this project. This dataset is publicly accessible and includes clinical information of ICU patients diagnosed with sepsis.

### 2. Initialize Your Project
Set up your Python environment and install necessary libraries which including but not limited to pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn etc. Make sure you're comfortable with Jupyter Notebooks, as it'll make the process of working with data and models more straightforward.

### 3. Explore and Preprocess the Data
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and perform a comprehensive data exploration and preprocessing. This may involve handling missing values, dealing with outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.

### 4. Feature Extraction
Use medical and data science expertise to extract key features that are most relevant for sepsis prediction. This may include symptoms, patient history, and other relevant factors. 

### 5. Model Training
In this step, you'll train a variety of machine learning models including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). You'll be using Scikit-Learn library for this.

### 6. Model Evaluation
After training the models, evaluate their performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Use Python's Scikit-Learn library, which provides tools such as `classification_report` and `roc_auc_score`. 

### 7. Results & Conclusion
Write a clear summary of your findings including which model worked best, any limitations you faced, and areas for future improvements.


## Conclusion
This guide should help you understand the steps necessary to complete this project, from installing required software, downloading and preprocessing the dataset, training and evaluating the model, and pushing your code to GitHub. Happy coding!
